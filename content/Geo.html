        geography, the study of the diverse environments, places, and spaces of Earth’s
         surface and their interactions. It seeks to answer the questions of why things are as they are, 
         where they are. The modern academic discipline of geography is rooted in ancient practice, 
         concerned with the characteristics of places, in particular their natural environments and peoples,
          as well as the relations between the two. 
        Its separate identity was first formulated and named some 2,000 years ago by the Greeks, 
        whose geo and graphein were combined to mean “earth writing” or “earth description.” However, 
        what is now understood as geography was elaborated before then, in the Arab world and elsewhere.
         Ptolemy, author of one of the discipline’s first books, Guide to Geography (2nd century ce),
          defined geography as “a representation in pictures of the whole known world together with the
           phenomena which are contained therein.” This expresses what many still consider geography’s
            essence—a description of the world using maps (and now also pictures, as in the kind of 
            “popular geographies” exemplified by National Geographic Magazine)—but, as more was learned 
            about the world, less could be mapped, and words were added to the pictures. <br><br>

To most people, geography means knowing where places are and what they are like. Discussion of an
 area’s geography usually refers to its topography—its relief and drainage patterns and predominant 
 vegetation, along with climate and weather patterns—together with human responses to that environment,
  as in agricultural, industrial, and other land uses and in settlement and urbanization patterns.<br><br>

Although there was a much earlier teaching of what is now called geography, the academic discipline is largely a 20th-century creation, forming a bridge between the natural and social sciences. The history of geography is the history of thinking about the concepts of environments, places, and spaces. Its content covers an understanding of the physical reality we occupy and our transformations of environments into places that we find more comfortable to inhabit (although many such modifications often have negative long-term impacts). Geography provides insights into major contemporary issues, such as globalization and environmental change, as well as a detailed appreciation of local differences; changes in disciplinary interests and practices reflect those issues.

        The term "geography" was coined by the Greek scholar Eratosthenes in the third century B.C.E. In Greek, geo- means “earth” and -graphy means “to write.” Using geography, Eratosthenes and other Greeks developed an understanding of where their homeland was located in relation to other places, what their own and other places were like, and how people and environments were distributed. These concerns have been central to geography ever since.

        Of course, the Greeks were not the only people interested in geography, nor were they the first. Throughout human history, most societies have sought to understand something about their place in the world, and the people and environments around them. Mesopotamian societies inscribed maps on clay tablets, some of which survive to this day. The earliest known attempt at mapping the world is a Babylonian clay tablet known as the Imago Mundi. This map, created in the sixth century B.C.E., is more of a metaphorical and spiritual representation of Babylonian society rather than an accurate depiction of geography. Other Mesopotamian maps were more practical, marking irrigation networks and landholdings.
        
        Indigenous peoples around the world developed geographic ideas and practices long before Eratosthenes. For example, Polynesian navigators embarked on long-range sea voyages across the Pacific Islands as early as 3000 years ago. The people of the Marshall Islands used navigation charts made of natural materials (“stick charts”) to visualize and memorize currents, wind patterns, and island locations.
        <br><br>
        
        Indeed, mapmaking probably came even before writing in many places, but ancient Greek geographers were particularly influential. They developed very detailed maps of Greek city-states, including parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. More importantly, they also raised questions about how and why different human and natural patterns came into being on Earth’s surface, and why variations existed from place to place. The effort to answer these questions about patterns and distribution led them to figure out that the world was round, to calculate Earth’s circumference, and to develop explanations of everything from the seasonal flooding of the Nile to differences in population densities from place to place.<br><br>
        
        During the Middle Ages, geography ceased to be a major academic pursuit in Europe. Advances in geography were chiefly made by scientists of the Muslim world, based around the Middle East and North Africa. Geographers of this Islamic Golden Age created an early example of a rectangular map based on a grid, a map system that is still familiar today. Islamic scholars also applied their study of people and places to agriculture, determining which crops and livestock were most suited to specific habitats or environments.
        
        In addition to the advances in the Middle East, the Chinese empire in Asia also contributed immensely to geography. Around 1000, Chinese navigators achieved one of the most important developments in the history of geography: They were the first to use the compass for navigational purposes. In the early 1400s, the explorer Zheng He embarked on seven voyages to the lands bordering the China Sea and the Indian Ocean, establishing China’s influence throughout Southeast Asia.

        <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Physical Geography</div>
        Physical geography investigates the Earth’s physical features and natural processes. It explores landforms, climates, vegetation, soils, and biogeography. Physical geographers study phenomena such as mountains, rivers, glaciers, weather systems, and ecosystems, analyzing their formation, characteristics, and interactions.
        <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Human Geography</div>
        Human geography examines the relationship between humans and their environment. It investigates population dynamics, urbanization, cultural landscapes, economic activities, and political systems. Human geographers analyze factors such as migration, globalization, urban development, and cultural diffusion to understand the spatial patterns of human behavior and societal processes.
        <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Environmental Geography</div>
        Environmental geography focuses on the interaction between humans and the environment, particularly the impact of human activities on natural systems. It addresses issues such as pollution, deforestation, resource depletion, and climate change. Environmental geographers strive to develop sustainable practices and policies to mitigate environmental degradation.
