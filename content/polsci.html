                id="the">Political Theory</span><br>
            Political theory is concerned mainly with the foundations of political community and institutions. It
            focuses on human nature and the moral purposes of political association. To clarify these concepts,
            political theorists draw on enduring political writings from ancient Greece to the present and on various
            writings by moral philosophers. Political theory also focuses on empirical research into the way political
            institutions function in practice. Here political theorists subject beliefs about political life found in
            important political writings to re-examination in the light of ongoing human behavior. In either case,
            political theory seeks to ultimately deepen political thinking and to spur citizens to responsible and
            creative political action.

            POL S 201, Introduction to Political Theory, provides students with an overview of the main lines of thought
            in political theory. Advanced courses focus on given concepts, topics, and thought in political theorizing.

                id="com">Comparative Politics</span><br>
            Comparative politics is a broad field with a variety of approaches and goals. Some scholars and researchers
            compare contemporary political systems in order to judge which types best provide particular values: order,
            equality, freedom, or economic security and well-being for their citizens. Others suggest that the main
            purpose of comparative politics is to provide an understanding of how and why different societies develop
            different kinds of political institutions. Still others use comparative politics as a way of discovering
            general laws and theories that will explain human political behavior and its variability.

            Comparative politics courses are of two basic types. One offers comparisons of a particular set of problems
            or institutions in a number of different countries. The second type offers in-depth analyses of the basic
            political institutions and processes of a single country or group of countries in a world region.

            Most students will want to begin their study of comparative politics with the Introduction to Comparative
            Politics (POL S 204), which combines the two main approaches by including comparative discussions of
            particular problems, issues, processes, and institutions in a wide variety of political settings as well as
            in-depth readings and lectures on some of the major countries in the contemporary world.

                id="int">International Relations</span><br>
            The field of international relations is concerned with developing an understanding of why states and
            non-state international actors, like the United Nations and multinational corporations, interact as they do.
            International relations is a diverse field both in terms of what kinds of behavior are studied and how they
            are studied. International conflict, particularly war, continues to be an important focus of the field. Why
            do wars start? Who wins and why? How can wars be prevented? What is the role of international law and
            organizations? As the world has become more interdependent, scholars have become more aware of the
            importance of international economic activity. As a result, scholars are analyzing world trade,
            communications, development, foreign investment, and international finance. How states make foreign policy
            decisions is another important area of study. National security policy, nuclear deterrence, arms control and
            defense spending decisions are typical examples of foreign policy decisions.

            POL S 203, International Relations, introduces the student to International politics. This is the foundation
            for a wide variety of offerings at the 300 and 400 levels, such as American foreign policy, global
            environmental politics, international political economy, and international conflict.

                id="met">Political Methodology</span><br>
            The subfield of political methodology is concerned with the philosophical bases of political science, social
            science, empirical research design and analysis, and practical field research experience.

            Courses in the political methodology field cover philosophical issues regarding the possibility of a science
            of politics, the similarities and differences between political science and other social sciences,
            alternative modes of explanation, and the truth of knowledge claims. They also examine the formulation of
            experimental and non-experimental research designs for making causal inferences about political processes
            and behavior and explore the. use of statistics, mathematics and computers for the analysis of political
            data generated by such research designs. Students are also provided an opportunity to conduct individual and
            group research projects through seminars. The political methodology faculty have current research and
            teaching interests in such diverse topics as mass media, feminist theory, language politics, political
            economy, rational choice theory, and public policy.

                    stroke of the midnight hour on August 15, 1947, India awoke to life and freedom. It was an
                    independence hard earned; over two hundred years of blood, sweat, revolution and sacrifice were
                    spent in throwing off the yoke of colonialism. But from it emerged a country whose long and ancient
                    history was only matched by the sheer opportunities before it. It was the home of ancient
                    civilisations. It was the world’s largest democracy. It had the world’s second largest population,
                    hundreds of religions, languages, communities and cultures. But there was much to do. India was a
                    resource-rich country, breathtaking in its expanse of geography and opportunity. But it was poor,
                    plundered by the British. It boasted a literacy rate of just 12%. Its public health infrastructure
                    was woefully inadequate. On August 15, India began the process of changing all this on its own
                    terms, as a free country. India began its tryst with destiny. <br><img

                <li><span style="font-weight:700;font-size: 20px;">Partition rocks the new nation (1947) :</span><br>
                    The country’s independence was framed by a bloody, brutal partition that cleaved its territory into
                    two on religious lines – a secular India, and a Muslim Pakistan (in two parts East and West).
                    British judge Cyril Radcliffe took a mere 40 days to draw 6,100 km of new boundaries both to India’s
                    west and east. This resulted in unprecedented scenes as a million people were killed (some estimates
                    put the toll at double this) and 15 million migrated to either side of the border, on foot or on
                    trains. The partition of India is a defining moment not just for what happened then, but what it has
                    meant since. It left the country with a hostile neighbour, Pakistan, with which it has fought
                    several wars, and which has supported terror groups in Punjab and Kashmir. <br><img

                <li><span style="font-weight:700;font-size: 20px;"> Kashmir accedes to India (1947) :</span><br>
                    Two months after India gained independence, on October 26, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir,
                    signed the instrument of accession to India. In August, the princely state had sought a “standstill
                    arrangement” with both India and Pakistan, which India refused to sign, articulating a stance that
                    has lasted since-- that Kashmir is an inseparable part of India.

                    Pakistan reacted by mobilising tribesmen who entered Kashmir’s borders. Pushed into a corner, Singh
                    signed the instrument of accession. These complex circumstances defined Kashmir’s immediate and long
                    term future. The instrument became central to Article 370, abrogated by the BJP in 2019. In 1948,
                    Prime Minister Nehru took the matter to the United Nations, which passed a resolution calling for a
                    ceasefire, the withdrawal of Pakistani troops and tribal militia, and finally a referendum. But the
                    armies never pulled back, giving rise to today’s Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, and the referendum never
                    took place, giving rise to an angst that Pakistan based terror groups exploit. <br><img

                    On January 30, 1948, at 5:17 pm four shots rang out at New Delhi’s Birla Niketan, shocking India and
                    the world. On the floor, in a thick cloud of smoke lay the man synonymous with India’s freedom
                    movement; who had had led the Dandi March and the Non Cooperation Movement; who had built a new
                    vocabulary of non-violent protest; and who had earned the moniker Mahatma all over the world. Free
                    for a matter of months, and confronting enormous economic, social and political challenges, India
                    had lost its tallest leader. <br><img

                    <span style="font-weight:700;font-size: 20px;"> India gets a Constitution (1950) :</span><br>
                    India came into its own as a democratic republic on January 26, 1950 – a day celebrated since as
                    Republic Day. It was the day India adopted its own Constitution, a text 145,000 words long,
                    breathtaking in its intellectual expanse, and its imagination of a diverse and vibrant federal
                    democracy. The Constitution was written by India’s finest minds, led by BR Ambedkar, with the
                    Constituent Assembly sitting for 11 sessions, and 167 days over 2 years and 11 months.

                    The Constitution set the framework for India’s politics, adopting Universal Adult Franchise – the
                    inalienable right of all citizens to vote and to participate in India’s democratic process. It also
                    defined the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary and gave to India a
                    set of fundamental rights . The Preamble to the Constitution laid bare what India held dearest –
                    that it was a sovereign, secular, democratic republic that believed in liberty of expression,
                    belief, faith and worship, equality of status and opportunity. <br><img
