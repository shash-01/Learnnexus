            <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Accounting Period</div>
            An accounting period defines the length of time covered by a financial statement or operation. Examples of commonly used accounting periods include fiscal years, calendar years, and three-month calendar quarters. Some organizations also use monthly periods. Each accounting period covers one complete accounting cycle. An accounting cycle is an eight-step system accountants use to track transactions during a particular period.<br><br>
           

            <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Accounts Receivable </div>


            Accounts receivable ( AR) tracks the money owed to a person or business by its debtors. It is the functional opposite of accounts payable.

            Accounts receivable are sometimes called "trade receivables." In most cases, accounts receivable derive from products or services supplied on credit or without an upfront payment. Accountants track accounts receivable money as assets.<br><br>
            
            <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Accounts Payable</div>
            Accounts payable (AP) tracks money owed to creditors. Examples include bank loans, unpaid bills and invoices, debts to suppliers or vendors, and credit card or line of credit debts. Rarely, the term "trade payables" is used in place of "accounts payable." Accounts payable belong to a larger class of accounting entries known as liabilities.<br><br>

            <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Assets </div>
            Assets are items of value, or resources that a business owns or controls. More technical and precise definitions specify two technicalities: First, assets result from past business activities. Second, they will or are expected to generate future economic value. Assets come in many types and classes. Types include current and noncurrent, operating and nonoperating, physical, and intangible. Classes include broad categories such as cash and equivalents, equities, commodities, real estate, intellectual property, and fixed income, among others. <br> <br>

            <div class="sec2"><div class="hdng1">Capital</div>
            In common usage, capital (abbreviated "CAP.") refers to any asset or resource a business can use to generate revenue. A second definition considers capital the level of owner investment in the business. The latter sense of the term adjusts these investments for any gains or losses the owner(s) have already realized.Accountants recognize various subcategories of capital. Working capital defines the sum that remains after subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Equity capital specifies the money paid into a business by investors in exchange for stock in the company. Debt capital covers money obtained through credit instruments such as loans.<br> <br>
