                is Chemistry?</span> Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, composition, and
            interactions. It is often referred to as the central science because it connects and bridges the physical
            sciences, such as physics and biology. Understanding chemistry is crucial for comprehending the world around
            us, from the air we breathe to the food we eat and the materials we use in everyday life.

            Chemistry has many sub-disciplines such as analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, biochemistry, and more.
            Chemistry plays a crucial role in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, materials science,
            environmental science, and energy production, making it a cornerstone of modern science and technology

            The area of science devoted to studying nature and also composition, properties, elements, and compounds
            that form matter as well as looking into their reactions forming new substances is chemistry. Chemistry has
            also been categorized further based on the particular areas of study.

            Chemistry focuses on the properties, both physical and chemical structure, transformations they undergo as
            well as the energy that is either absorbed or released during reactions that accompany these structural
            changes.

            All materials on earth whether they are naturally occurring or are artificially produced include fundamental
            units known as atoms. These atoms also consist of elementary particles, but they are called the structural
            and fundamental entities of chemical substances.

            Chemistry includes writing the composition of compounds, their uses, and also how they are used along with
            the synthesis of new compounds by combining two or more substances.

            Chemical processes include cooking, fermentation, glass making, and also metallurgy. Advancements in
            chemical technology have led to the production of semiconductors, liquid crystals, Teflon, and also
            superconductors among others.

                of Chemistry</span><br>
            Chemistry is divided into five branches as follows:
            <ul>
                <li id="scndlst">Physical Chemistry</li>
                <li id="scndlst">Organic Chemistry</li>
                <li id="scndlst">Inorganic Chemistry</li>
                <li id="scndlst">Analytical Chemistry</li>
                <li id="scndlst">Biochemistry</li>
            </ul> <br><br>

                Chemistry</span><br>
            Here, this
            field of chemistry focuses on the many processes and changes that take place in materials. It tries
            to quantify, correlate, and rationalize the structural properties of reactions through its unique
            approach focusing on physical principles underlying all chemical interactions (e.g., gas laws). It
            is a combination of physics and also chemistry to examine the elements in a superior manner.

            In physical chemistry, we can see how molecules and atoms interact with each other to create
            specific molecules. We can also know many other aspects of the issue, such as those relating to its
            transformation from solidity into liquid.

                Chemistry</span><br>
            Organic
            chemistry is one of the branches of this science that describes the structure, properties, and
            reactions of carbohydrates having carbon atoms as a dominant element. Chemicals in this branch are
            hydrocarbons (compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) as well as other substances that
            contain carbon along with oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus halogens etc.

            These substances and chemicals make up the organic compounds that dominate over earthly life forms.

                Chemistry</span><br>
            This
            category contains the analysis of non-carbon compounds and also some organometallic combinations. It
            primarily discusses the non-carbon compounds. Most inorganic compounds are ionic, comprising the
            cations and anions linked by ion-covalent bonds. The study of oxides, carbonates, sulfates and also
            halides are included in the Inorganic compounds.

            a number of techniques to study and measure substances like separation, the identification or
            quantification This branch may employ classical methods, wet chemical methods and also modern
            analytical techniques.
