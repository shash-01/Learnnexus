        <h1 >Inorganic Chemistry</h1>
        <div id="p1"> If organic chemistry is defined as the chemistry of hydrocarbon compounds and their derivatives, inorganic chemistry can be described very generally as the chemistry of noncarbon compounds or as the chemistry of everything else. This includes all the remaining elements in the periodic table (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2) and some compounds of carbon (such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)), which plays a major role in many inorganic compounds. Thus, inorganic chemistry is the subcategory of chemistry concerned with the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds, which includes all chemical compounds without the chains or rings of carbon atoms that fall into the subcategory of organic compounds.
            A common differentiation to help distinguish between inorganic compounds and organic compounds is that inorganic compounds are either the result of natural processes unrelated to any life form or the result of human experimentation in the laboratory, whereas organic compounds result from the activity of living beings. However, caution is advised when using such a definition because organic compounds can be artificially created in the laboratory. Another definition pertains to the salt-making property of inorganic compounds, which is absent in organic compound, but even then, this definition too is not truly correct since organic acids (RCO2H) sacrosanct can also form salts. There is also the argument that inorganic compounds do not have carbon-hydrogen bonds—a characteristic of organic compounds—but this, also, is not strictly true since perfluorocarbons (carbon-fluorine compounds where all of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms) do not have any carbon-hydrogen bonds but are still organic compounds. Another often-quoted difference is that inorganic compounds contain metal atoms, whereas organic compounds do not. Again, this is not true since organometallic compounds contain metal atoms. Thus, caution is advised when accepting any definition that purports to define the differences between inorganic compounds and organic compounds.
